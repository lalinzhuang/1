# Mayavi workshop material

This repository contains material for a two-day course on
[Mayavi](https://github.com/enthought/mayavi). The course was taught first at
the
[NGCM (Next Generational Computational Modeling) Summer Academy](http://ngcm.soton.ac.uk/summer-academy/)
in 2016. The course was again conducted in 2017. The material was in the form
of slides made using LaTeX and some Jupyter notebooks.

In 2018 the material was revamped and converted to [Jupyter
notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). The older material is converted into
notebooks in the form of
[ipyaml](https://github.com/prabhuramachandran/ipyaml) documents which can be
easily converted into Jupyter notebooks.

The source, PDF, and Jupyter notebooks are in the [slides directory](https://github.com/prabhuramachandran/mayavi-workshop/tree/master/slides).
